# Color-Remember-Game
************************************************************
INTRODUCTION
************************************************************

This is a small web application game I made when I was
learning full stack web development. This was one of the
first few ideas that I had in mind.

The objective of the game is simple. Try to remember the
length of the pattern shown as long as possible.

HOW TO PLAY
************************************************************

- Press any key at the start.
- A color will animate. Remember that color of the button,
and then press it. You will get to level 2.
- A new color will animate. Remember that color of the
button.
- Now press the first color button when the game first 
started, and the color button animated now in order. Then
you will advance to level 3.
-  As you will progress to greater levels, you will have
to remember more colors in the order they were animating.
- Once you press the color button that does not match the
order, the game is over.
